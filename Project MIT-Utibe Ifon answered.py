#  # FoodHub Data Analysis

# # Context
# 
# The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.
# 
# The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.
# 
# ### Objective
# 
# The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business. 
# 
# ### Data Description
# 
# The data contains the different data related to a food order. The detailed data dictionary is given below.
# 
# ### Data Dictionary
# 
# * order_id: Unique ID of the order
# * customer_id: ID of the customer who ordered the food
# * restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant
# * cuisine_type: Cuisine ordered by the customer
# * cost: Cost of the order
# * day_of_the_week: Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or weekend (The weekday is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday)
# * rating: Rating given by the customer out of 5
# * food_preparation_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to prepare the food. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the restaurant's order confirmation and the delivery person's pick-up confirmation.
# * delivery_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the delivery person's pick-up confirmation and drop-off information

# Orders received on Weekends are more than that of weekdays for all cusine types.
# 
# Orders received for Spanish, Korean,Thai and French on Weekdays are significantly less than orders received on weekends.
# 
# Japenese, Mexican, American, Indian, Italian, Mediterranean Chinese and Middle Eastern have equal amounts of orders on Weekends, comparative difference  exists only on weekdays.

# ### Observation:
# For the orders that were rated, delivery times below 24.25 minutes were rated a rating of 4 or higher.

# It is possible that delivery time may play a role in the low rating of orders.

# ### Rating vs Cost of Order

# In[106]:


plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))
sns.pointplot(data=df, x='rating',y='cost_of_the_order')

# #### Orders that take more than 60 minutes to get delivered

# In[144]:


#new column called total_time
df['total_time'] = df['food_preparation_time'] +df['delivery_time']
#percentage of orders > 60 minutes total delivery time

# #### Mean delivery between weekends and weekdays

# In[145]:


##mean delivery for weekdays
print('The mean delivery time on weekdays is', 
      round(df[df['day_of_the_week'] == 'Weekday']['delivery_time'].mean()),
     'minutes')


# In[148]:


##mean delivery for weekends
print('The mean delivery time on weekend is',round(df[df['day_of_the_week']=='Weekend']['delivery_time'].mean()),'minutes')


# ## Conclusions and Recommendations

# ### Conclusions:
# The top 3 most popular cusines: American, Japanese and Italian account for about 70% of the total orders. This shows that these cuisines are quite preferable to the FoodHub customers.
# 
# Shake Shack restaurant has had the highest number of orders, and consequentially the highest number of ratings.
# 
# The Meatball Shop is the restaurant with the highest average rating (4.51)
# 
# The amount of orders more than double during the weekend. This shows Foodhub customers prefer to order on weekends than weekdays.
# 
# There are longer delivery times during the weekdays, and reduced delivery times on the weekends.
# 

# ### Recommendations:
# Foodhub should collaborate with the restaurants that serve American, Japanese and Italian cuisine. These are the 3 most popular amongst Foodhub customers and thus might be a profitable venture for the company.
# 
# The number of orders not rated by customers is 736, which amounts to about 38.8 percent of total orders. Rating is an important way to tell the level of customer satisfaction. Therefore the company should investigate why so many orders don't get rated, and maybe incentivise customers to rate their orders.
# 
# 
# There is a clear preference for ordering on the weekend, the company should take advantage of this by making more delivery personnel to be available on weekends so as to meet up with this increasing demand.
